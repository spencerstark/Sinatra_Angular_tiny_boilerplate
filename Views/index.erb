<!-- 
we're splitting our code. This may look complicated, but 
realistically we're just splitting the layout and index
logically based on what we would want to see where. 

The index appears in the yield on the layout. 
The layout has our scripts and style and starts the Angular app.
This might not be the right way to do it but I'm exploring right now. 
if false is an easy way to comment out a large block of code.
